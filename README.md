# Mvc-Stock-Tracking-Site
Stock tracking system developed using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework. Allows users to add, update, delete, and monitor stock levels. Integrated with SQL Server to ensure secure and efficient data storage. Implemented Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for a modular and scalable structure.
I used Asp.Net MVC,SQL,EntyFramework,html,css technologies while making the project.
